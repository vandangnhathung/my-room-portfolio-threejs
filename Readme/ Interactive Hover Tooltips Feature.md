Interactive Hover Tooltips Feature
What We Built
We've added a smart "hover information system" to your 3D room experience. Now, when you move your mouse over any interactive object in the room, a beautiful information card automatically appears, telling you exactly what that object is and what you can do with it.
How It Works (Simple Explanation)
Before: You saw objects in the 3D room, but had no idea what they were or if you could interact with them.
Now: Simply hover your mouse over any object and instantly see:

📝 What it is - "Professional Camera", "Executive Chair", etc.
🏷️ What category - Electronics, Furniture, Lighting, etc.
📖 Description - A helpful explanation of the object
💡 What you can do - "Click to take a photo", "Watch it rotate", etc.

User Experience

Move your mouse over any object in the 3D room
Information appears instantly in a sleek popup card
Card follows your mouse as you move around the object
Disappears smoothly when you move away

What Makes It Special
✨ Smart & Informative - Every object has detailed, helpful information
✨ Beautiful Design - Professional-looking cards with smooth animations
✨ Intuitive - Works exactly how you'd expect - just hover and learn
✨ Fast & Responsive - Information appears instantly with no delays
✨ Non-Intrusive - Only shows when you want it, disappears when you don't
Real Examples

Hover over the camera → "Professional Camera | Electronics | A high-quality camera for capturing moments | 💡 Click to take a photo"
Hover over the chair → "Rotating Executive Chair | Furniture | A premium executive chair that gently rotates | 💡 Watch it rotate automatically"
Hover over the monitor → "Computer Monitor | Electronics | A modern monitor for work and entertainment | 💡 Click to turn on/off"

The Bottom Line
This feature transforms your 3D room from a silent, mysterious space into an interactive, informative experience. Users no longer have to guess what objects are or wonder if they can interact with them - the room now tells them everything they need to know with elegant, helpful tooltips.
It's like having a smart tour guide built right into your 3D experience! 🏠✨
