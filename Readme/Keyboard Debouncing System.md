# Keyboard Debouncing System Documentation

## Overview
The Keyboard Debouncing System prevents rapid-fire keyboard interactions during camera transitions in the 3D scene. This system ensures smooth camera animations by blocking multiple key presses until the current transition completes, preventing conflicts and improving user experience.

## Problem Statement

### Original Issues
1. **Rapid Key Presses**: Users could spam the Escape key during camera transitions, causing multiple `resetCamera()` calls
2. **Animation Conflicts**: Multiple simultaneous camera animations could interfere with each other
3. **Poor User Experience**: Camera movements became jerky and unpredictable when users pressed keys rapidly
4. **State Inconsistencies**: The camera focus state could become inconsistent due to overlapping transition requests

### Technical Challenges
- GSAP animations have fixed durations (1-1.4 seconds)
- Camera focus state changes during transitions
- OrbitControls need to be disabled during transitions
- Multiple rapid key presses could queue up multiple animations

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Debouncing Hook (`useDebounceKeydown`)
- **Purpose**: Manages keyboard event debouncing with configurable delays
- **State Management**: Tracks debouncing status and timeout references
- **Cleanup**: Properly clears timeouts to prevent memory leaks

#### 2. Integration with Camera Focus System
- **Timing Coordination**: Debounce delay matches camera transition durations
- **State Synchronization**: Debouncing state affects OrbitControls behavior
- **Event Filtering**: Prevents key events during active transitions

#### 3. User Interaction Management
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains responsiveness while preventing conflicts
- **Visual Feedback**: OrbitControls disabled during debouncing periods
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminates race conditions in camera state

## Implementation Details

### Hook Structure
```typescript
interface UseDebounceKeydownOptions {
  delay?: number                    // Debounce delay in milliseconds
  onKeyDown?: (event: KeyboardEvent) => void  // Key down handler
  onKeyUp?: (event: KeyboardEvent) => void    // Key up handler
}

interface UseDebounceKeydownReturn {
  handleKeyDown: (event: KeyboardEvent) => void  // Debounced key handler
  handleKeyUp: (event: KeyboardEvent) => void    // Key up handler
  isDebouncing: boolean                          // Current debouncing state
  clearDebounce: () => void                      // Manual debounce clear
}
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Debouncing Logic
```typescript
const handleKeyDown = useCallback((event: KeyboardEvent) => {
  // If already debouncing, ignore the key press
  if (isDebouncingRef.current) {
    return
  }

  // Set debouncing state
  isDebouncingRef.current = true

  // Call the original onKeyDown handler
  if (onKeyDown) {
    onKeyDown(event)
  }

  // Set timeout to clear debouncing state
  timeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
    isDebouncingRef.current = false
    timeoutRef.current = null
  }, delay)
}, [delay, onKeyDown])
```

#### 2. State Management
- **`isDebouncingRef`**: Tracks current debouncing state
- **`timeoutRef`**: Manages the debounce timeout
- **`clearDebounce()`**: Manual cleanup function

#### 3. Integration with Camera System
```typescript
// In MyRoom.tsx
const { handleKeyDown: debouncedKeyDown, isDebouncing } = useDebounceKeydown({
  delay: 500, // 500ms debounce delay
  onKeyDown: (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (event.code === "Escape" && isCameraFocused) {
      resetCamera()
    }
  }
})
```

## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```typescript
// 1. Import the hook
import { useDebounceKeydown } from "@/hooks/use-debounce-keydown"

// 2. Create debounced handler
const { handleKeyDown: debouncedKeyDown, isDebouncing } = useDebounceKeydown({
  delay: 500,
  onKeyDown: (event) => {
    // Your key handling logic here
    if (event.code === "Escape") {
      resetCamera()
    }
  }
})

// 3. Add event listener
React.useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener("keydown", debouncedKeyDown)
  return () => window.removeEventListener("keydown", debouncedKeyDown)
}, [debouncedKeyDown])
```

### Advanced Configuration
```typescript
// Custom delay for different transitions
const { handleKeyDown: debouncedKeyDown } = useDebounceKeydown({
  delay: 1500, // Longer delay for complex animations
  onKeyDown: (event) => {
    // Handle multiple key combinations
    if (event.code === "Escape") {
      resetCamera()
    }
    if (event.code === "KeyF" && event.ctrlKey) {
      focusOnScreen()
    }
  },
  onKeyUp: (event) => {
    // Handle key up events if needed
    console.log('Key released:', event.code)
  }
})
```

### Integration with OrbitControls
```typescript
<OrbitControls 
  ref={orbitControlsRef}
  // ... other props
  enableRotate={!isCameraFocused && !isDebouncing} // Disable during transitions
/>
```

## Configuration Options

### Delay Timing
| Transition Type | Recommended Delay | Reasoning |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| Camera Focus | 500ms | Allows 1s animation + buffer |
| Camera Reset | 1500ms | Allows 1.4s animation + buffer |
| Complex Transitions | 2000ms | Multiple animations |

### State Integration
```typescript
// Combine multiple states for comprehensive control
const isInteractionDisabled = isCameraFocused || isDebouncing || isLoading

<OrbitControls 
  enableRotate={!isInteractionDisabled}
  enableZoom={!isInteractionDisabled}
  enablePan={false}
/>
```

## Problem Resolution

### Issue 1: Rapid Key Presses
**Problem**: Users could spam Escape key during transitions
**Solution**: Debouncing prevents multiple calls until transition completes
```typescript
// Before: Multiple rapid calls
if (event.code === "Escape") {
  resetCamera() // Could be called multiple times
}

// After: Debounced calls
const { handleKeyDown: debouncedKeyDown } = useDebounceKeydown({
  delay: 500,
  onKeyDown: (event) => {
    if (event.code === "Escape") {
      resetCamera() // Only called once per debounce period
    }
  }
})
```

### Issue 2: Animation Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple simultaneous camera animations
**Solution**: Debouncing ensures only one animation runs at a time
```typescript
// Animation state management
const [isAnimating, setIsAnimating] = useState(false)

const resetCamera = useCallback(() => {
  if (isAnimating) return // Prevent multiple animations
  
  setIsAnimating(true)
  // ... animation logic
  // Reset in onComplete callback
}, [isAnimating])
```

### Issue 3: State Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Camera focus state could become inconsistent
**Solution**: Debouncing state prevents state changes during transitions
```typescript
// State consistency
const isInteractionDisabled = isCameraFocused || isDebouncing

// All interactions respect this state
<OrbitControls enableRotate={!isInteractionDisabled} />
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Timing Considerations
- **Match Animation Duration**: Set debounce delay to animation duration + buffer
- **User Experience**: Don't make delays too long (max 2 seconds)
- **Responsiveness**: Keep delays as short as possible while preventing conflicts

### 2. State Management
- **Clear State**: Always clear debouncing state after timeout
- **Cleanup**: Remove event listeners in useEffect cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases where animations might fail

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **useCallback**: Wrap handlers in useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **useRef**: Use refs for timeout management to avoid stale closures
- **Memory Leaks**: Always clear timeouts in cleanup functions

### 4. Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure debouncing doesn't interfere with accessibility
- **Visual Feedback**: Provide clear indication when interactions are disabled
- **Alternative Controls**: Consider mouse/touch alternatives for key-based actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Debouncing Too Aggressive
**Symptoms**: Keys feel unresponsive
**Solution**: Reduce delay time or add visual feedback
```typescript
const { handleKeyDown: debouncedKeyDown, isDebouncing } = useDebounceKeydown({
  delay: 300, // Reduced from 500ms
  onKeyDown: (event) => { /* ... */ }
})

// Add visual feedback
{isDebouncing && <div>Processing...</div>}
```

#### 2. Memory Leaks
**Symptoms**: Performance degradation over time
**Solution**: Ensure proper cleanup
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener("keydown", debouncedKeyDown)
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("keydown", debouncedKeyDown)
    clearDebounce() // Clear any pending timeouts
  }
}, [debouncedKeyDown, clearDebounce])
```

#### 3. State Synchronization Issues
**Symptoms**: UI state doesn't match actual camera state
**Solution**: Ensure all state changes go through the debouncing system
```typescript
// Centralized state management
const handleCameraAction = (action: () => void) => {
  if (!isDebouncing && !isCameraFocused) {
    action()
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements
